# AI-Driven-Demand-Forecasting-and-Dynamic-Pricing
Project Overview
This project leverages the Prophet model to build a robust forecasting solution for predicting sales, demand, and optimizing pricing strategies. The primary components of the project include:

1. Sales and Demand Forecasting
The Prophet model is used to predict sales and demand trends based on historical data. The model captures seasonal patterns, holidays, and other external factors to generate accurate forecasts.

2. Price Optimization
The project implements an optimization algorithm that adjusts pricing to maximize revenue or profit while considering demand elasticity.

3. Dynamic Pricing
Dynamic pricing strategies are developed using Prophet's forecasted values to adjust prices in real-time based on current demand and other factors.
